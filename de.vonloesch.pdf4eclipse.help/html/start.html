<h1>Pdf4Eclipse</h1>
Pdf4Eclipse is a pdf viewer which integrates nicely into the Eclipse workbench. 

<h2>PDF renderer</h2>
Since version 1.1.0, Pdf4Eclipse supports two different libraries to render the pdf documents. 
The pdf renderer from SUN is fast and supports a wide range of documents. It does not support
CID Type 0 fonts, which are often used in documents with Asian character sets.
The JPedal renderer has a higher compatibility and supports all font types. It is a little
bit slower though. You can change the renderer used in Pdf4Eclipse's preferences.

<h2>Navigation</h2>
To navigate in a pdf document you can use the keyboard or the mouse wheel. If  
"Pseudo continuous scrolling" is enabled, you can scroll through the whole document
using the mouse wheel. Otherwise you can only scroll on the current page.
Besides that it is possible to jump to a specific page number by entering it 
into the page field in the status bar, or using the navigation arrows.<br />

<h3>Outline</h3>
If it is included in the pdf document, Pdf4Eclipse can show the bookmarks 
(often more like a table of contents) of the document in the <i>Outline view</i>.
You can directly jump to a specific bookmark by selecting it in the outline.

<h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3>
Another possibility to navigate in a pdf is by using annotations which are 
marked by a red frame in the document. By clicking inside this frame you go 
to the specified location. This could also be a web page in which case a 
browser window is opened.<br />
You can always go back to the last position by using the navigation buttons
in the task bar or the corresponding entries in the <i>Navigate</i>-Menu.
<br />

The highlighting of annotations can be turned on and off 
by a button in the task bar.<br />

<h2>Zoom</h2>
You can change the presentation of the pdf by changing the zoom factor with the
buttons on the task bar or '+' and '-' keys. <br />

It is also possible to change the zoom level by using the mouse wheel 
while the ctrl-key is pressed.
